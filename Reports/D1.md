# Requirements

Each requirement has an associated ID. Each ID has two initial letters referring to the highest-level category (below functional and non-functional) it belongs to. Where appropriate, some IDs have a middle single letter referring to a subcategory. All IDs then have a two-digit number which distinguishes it from the other IDs which share its aforementioned letters. Periods separate each of these three components.

Priority numbers are given before each requirement ID. Priority is given on a scale from 1 to 3, where 1 means highest priority. Generally, a priority 1 element will be something that is present in the Project Overview. A priority 2 element will be something that adds an important functionality, while a priority of 3 suggests that the requirement is not necessary.
