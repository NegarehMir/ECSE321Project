# Workplan
Each item should be completed between the previous due date and its actual due date. Effort ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest effort (a quick formality) and 5 is the highest. Lowest priority items (indicated by their requirement's priority level) should not be developed past April 8.

Team members should work on items highest up in that week's due date section first, then continue on with lower items. Descriptions and priority level 1 requirements must be finished by each week's deadline. Lower priority requirements and tests may be worked on as long as the assigned team member has not worked more than six hours that week on this project.

## Already done:
- Add Album [ML.A.01]
